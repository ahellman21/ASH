###This is the Final Project Git repository for Aaron Hellman's Final Project in the Data Science Course in General Assembly in Austin Texas, Fall 2015 - Spring 2016.
The Project's goal was to see if there was any correlation between the Obesity Rate in The United States by County and other food factors that are recorded by the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration)

The 7 Jupyter Notebook files have all the code and work done and are ordered 0-6. 
They incluse all the work, regression, modeling and code that went into the project.
The project is split into mutiple files as it was easier to keep track and pick up work done from previous days during the duration of the project.

Presentation2.pptx is the final project presentation. 
The Farmers_market_Dir.csv, FoodSecAll.xls and OB_PREV_ALL_STATES.xlsx files are the data files used for the project and regression analysis.
